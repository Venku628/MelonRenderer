# MelonRenderer
A simple vulkan 3D renderer. This is a personal past time project developed to test implementations of rasterisation and raytracing.

Current Status: 
Rasterisation has been reimplemented in a basic way.
Raytracing is broken since the allignment of matrices has changed.


This project relies on the following libraries to function:  
https://github.com/glfw/glfw  
https://github.com/g-truc/glm  
https://github.com/ocornut/imgui  
https://github.com/nothings/stb  
https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader
